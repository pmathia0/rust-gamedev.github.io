Welcome to the 19th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Teki (敵)][teki]

![teki preview](teki.gif)

[Teki][teki] is a free and open-source fangame of the [Tōhō] series
using [SDL2] and [Legion] for ECS. It is aimed to be a shoot ’em up game with
"lots of bullets" a.k.a danmaku 弾幕 - literally "barrage" or "bullet curtain" in
Japanese.

The project is still at a “very” early stage of development (Dec. 2020).

This month's updates include:

- New enemy type: big fairy
- New special card: Stellar Vortex
- Add yin yang orbs

_Homing missiles periodically spawn from missile launcher enemies_

[Theta Wave] is a space shooter game by developers [@micah_tigley] and
[@carlosupina]. It is one of the showcase games for the [Amethyst Engine].
In the past month, they have been focusing on refactoring the motion system
to make the code more approachable to other contributors.

Notable changes:

- Missiles now spawn from missile launcher enemies
- Cursed background slowly fades in over the course of the level

### [Tetra]

_Tetra's demo game_

[Tetra] is a simple 2D game framework, inspired by XNA, Love2D and Raylib.
This month, version 0.6 was released, with some big changes and features:

- A simpler drawing API
- Less global state for mesh drawing
- Multisampled canvases
- Better font rendering

For more details, see the [changelog][tetra-changelog], or
[17cupsofcoffee's twitter thread][tetra-twitter] about the release.

### [A/B Street]

![Separate cyclepaths in A/B Street](./abstreet.png)

[A/B Street] by [@dabreegster] is a traffic simulation game exploring how small
changes to roads affect cyclists, transit users, pedestrians, and drivers, with
suppot for any city with OpenStreetMap coverage.

In February, [Bruce] implemented lagging green traffic signals, [Michael] and
[Yuwen] released the new day UI theme, more cyclepaths and service roads were
imported for all maps, and we added loads of maps, a new per-country picker UI,
and dynamic font loading. Try out [Taipei] in the web browser to see all of
this in action!

## Library & Tooling Updates

### [wgpu-rs]

wgpu-rs is a WebGPU implementation and API in Rust.

- "wgpu-core"-0.7.1 was published with fixes
- API updated for blending states, cull faces, vertex formats.
- zero-initialization of buffers upon use.
- validation of texture bindings, index formats for strip topologies.
- binding tracker was rewritten with test-ability in mind, bugs fixed.
- the player learned to resize the window properly. API traces can now
  be replayed on Linux even when swapchain recreation events are present.
- SPIRV-Cross was made optional, which was useful for Deno in order to
  work around the linking conflict with "rusty_v8".

[wgpu-rs]: https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs

### [gfx-rs]

gfx-rs is a portable low-level graphics abstraction layer.

- API got `PhysicalDeviceProperties` containing limits and properties of
  physical devices that are not opt-in.
- SPIRV-Cross dependency was made optional, while Naga is required.
- Vulkan backend learned to target Vulkan 1.1 and 1.2 internally.
- DX12 understood more limits.
- GL backend fixed WebGL initialization and EGL library discovery.

[gfx-rs]: https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx

### [naga]

naga is the shader translation library/tool.

- versions 0.3.1 and 0.3.2 were published with fixes
- API: function calls turned into statements, image queries and stores,
  understanding of push constants.
- validation: type validation was re-written and improved, new control flow
  analysis was added to check for uniformity requirements. In addition,
  this step now collects the image-sampler pairs used by the module.
- backends: lots of fixes and filling of the gaps
- infrastructure: `convert` example was removed in favor of the default
  binary target. The native shaders (produced by the snapshot tests)
  got validated on CI using platform tools.

### [rkyv]

[rkyv] is a zero-copy deserialization framework for Rust. It's similar to
FlatBuffers and Cap'n Proto and can be used for data storage and messaging.

[Version 0.4][rkyv-v0.4] was released this month and brought some big changes
and improvements:

- Major traits have been refactored and renamed to clarify their roles
- Shared pointers (`Rc`, `Arc`, `Weak`) can now be serialized, deserialized,
  and validated with correct ownership semantics
- Serialization, deserialization, and validation all now support custom contexts
- Greatly improved support for 32- and 64-bit archives by implementing Archive
  for `usize` and `isize`
- More comprehensive documentation in the [book][rkyv-book]

This release completes the project's initial feature set, and a
[request for feedback][rkyv-request-for-feedback] has been opened to help with
future project planning.
